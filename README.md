# Reels Counterüé¨


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Phantom OreoüöÄ

### Project Description
This project tracks the number of instagram reels or short videos a user watches within an application and displays a subtle notification when a certain number of videos is reached. The goal is to encourage users to take breaks and maintain healthy screen time habits.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We all know how easy it is to ‚Äújust watch one more‚Äù and suddenly an hour‚Äôs gone. Most people don‚Äôt even realize how much time they spend scrolling, and there‚Äôs usually nothing to remind them to stop.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
This app quietly counts your reels in the background and, when you‚Äôve hit a set milestone, pops up a message suggesting you put the phone down for a bit. It‚Äôs a small reminder to help you not go overboard with a little bit of sarcasm.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python (for icon generation script)
- Frameworks used: None (uses native WebExtension/Chrome Extension APIs)
- Libraries used: None external ‚Äî only built-in browser APIs (storage, activeTab)
- Tools used: VS Code , Warp AI (built-in AI coding assistant) , Command-line interface (CLI) , Git (for version control)


For Hardware:
- Main components: Desktop/laptop with a modern browser
- Specifications: Supports Chrome, Edge, Brave, or any Chromium browser with Extension Manifest V3 support
- Tools required: Internet connection for Instagram access

### Implementation
For Software:
- Manifest Configuration: Defines permissions (activeTab, storage) and sets up the extension to run on instagram.com.
- Content Script (content.js): Injected into Instagram to detect reel scrolling and update the counter.
- Storage API: Saves and retrieves the current reel count.
- Popup UI (popup.html, popup.js): Displays the counter and allows interaction from the extension icon.
- CSS Styling (styles.css): Styles the popup interface.
- Icons: Provided in PNG and SVG formats, with a Python script (create-icons.py) to generate them.
  
# Installation
[commands]

# Run
Once installed:  
1. Open Instagram in your browser.  
2. Start watching reels.  
3. The extension will track the number of reels scrolled and display it in the popup UI.
