# Reels Counterüé¨

### Project Description
This project tracks the number of instagram reels or short videos a user watches within an application and displays a subtle notification when a certain number of videos is reached. The goal is to encourage users to take breaks and maintain healthy screen time habits.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We all know how easy it is to ‚Äújust watch one more‚Äù and suddenly an hour‚Äôs gone. Most people don‚Äôt even realize how much time they spend scrolling, and there‚Äôs usually nothing to remind them to stop.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
This app quietly counts your reels in the background and, when you‚Äôve hit a set milestone, pops up a message suggesting you put the phone down for a bit. It‚Äôs a small reminder to help you not go overboard with a little bit of sarcasm.
